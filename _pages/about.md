Hi, welcome to my blog!

I’m Grace and I’m just some random person working in the IT industry who loves talking about Tech, Language Learning, Photography (most notably: Film Photography), and Living life as a Filipino expat in Japan.

When I’m not mindlessly scrolling through social media, you can find me at a photowalk, a language exchange event, or right beside a vending machine drinking 100-yen coffee.

This page is just a test page for my [actual blog page](https://grayinfilm.com/).
